# Eligibility Checker Program
## Description:
This program determines whether a person is eligible or not based on their age. If the age is less than 12 or greater than 50, the program prints "eligible"; otherwise, it prints "not eligible".

## Code Overview:

The program consists of two main parts:
  -  The Eligible function, which takes an integer age as input and prints "eligible" or "not eligible" based on the age.
  -  The main function, which prompts the user for their age, calls the Eligible function with the input age, and returns 0 to indicate successful execution.
